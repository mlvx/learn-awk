# "Awk is a programming language designed for processing plain text data."

From the resource at http://write.flossmanuals.net/command-line/awk/

- Small;
- Easy to learn;
- Ideal for quick, easy text processing;
- Prime use: Extract data from table-like input.

The file   `example.data`   has a small sample of data in tabular format
(Donkey Kong high scores), with which to practice using Awk.
